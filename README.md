## Overview

The final concept of this database solution is to provide the user with data in a secure yet convenient way. 
Research data will be made available to users through a web-based front-end using the latest high-security standards.

## Get started
_uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000_

for the Frontend:

_npm run dev_ 

// do not forget to locate the correct frontend folder first //

## Docker setup

```bash
DATABASE_HOSTNAME=mysql
DATABASE_PORT=3456
DATABASE_NAME=test_db
DATABASE_USERNAME=test_db
DATABASE_PASSWORD=***********
FRONTEND_PATH=path/to/frontend.dockerfile
```

Create an second environment file for docker `\frontend\.env` with the following environment variables 
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_NAME_ONE=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_MAIL_ONE=Your EMail
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_NAME_TWO=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_MAIL_TWO=Your EMail
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABHOLER_ONE=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABHOLER_TWO=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABHOLER_THREE=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABHOLER_FOUR=Your Name
